    <h1>CSS</h1>

    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, 
        including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility 
        and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by 
        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
